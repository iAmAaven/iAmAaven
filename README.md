# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

**My name is Aapo!**
I'm an IT engineering student from Finland with a special passion for code. I've been programming since **2019**, specializing in **video game development**.

---
### ðŸŽ® What I Do:
- **Game Development**: Crafting engaging and fun video games has been my main focus. I'm currently working on several small games, aiming for releases throughout **2025**. My goal in game development is to one day create a game that leaves a lasting impact on players.
- **Websites**: On occasion, I'll have an idea for a website, and I begin creating it immediately. Currently, I'm working on a personal portfolio through GitHub Pages.
- **Learning**: I enjoy reading about the latest in technology, software development, and programming.
- **Hobbies**: When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing guitar, making music, digital drawing, playing basketball, and escaping my monitor's light by diving into the immersive world of Dungeons & Dragons.

All my released games are available for free on my [itch.io page!](https://iamaaven.itch.io/) ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸŒŸ Fun Facts:
- Iâ€™m a huge fan of **indie games** and minimalist design, though I often like to evoke feelings through visuals in my projects.
- Something I enjoy as much as programming is **listening to music**. If I start talking to somebody, it's almost always about music or coding.
- My first experience with programming was with Python in 8th grade. After a three-year break from writing code, I got into making video games with Unity and it quickly grew into a lifelong passion.
- Iâ€™m always up for a **tech chat** or brainstorming new game ideas!
