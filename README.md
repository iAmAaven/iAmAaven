# Hello, my name is Aapo Harjunpää!

I'm a 23-year-old software developer and IT engineering student from Finland.  
I've been programming **since 2019**, specializing in video game development.

---
### About me
- I’m a huge fan of **indie games**, mostly because I'm an indie developer myself.
- My first experience with programming was with Python in 8th grade. After a three-year break from writing code, I got into making video games with Unity.
- My goal is to someday publish a game with a story so great that it leaves a lasting (positive) impact on players.
- Something I enjoy as much as programming is **music**. I've played the guitar for 9 years and listen to all kinds of music, though most often heavy metal.
- Occasionally I escape the light of my monitor to cast spells in Dungeons & Dragons with my friends.
- You can (very rarely) catch me streaming video game development on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/iamaaven)!
